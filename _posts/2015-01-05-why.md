# Why

Microsoft Azure is one of the lead cloud computing platforms. Rust is one of the most promising languages of the last decade. So why not use them both? 
Microsoft Azure exposes every functionality via a well written REST API. While excellent, these APIs can be enhanced by exploting Rust's great type system. 

This SDK helps to hide the more complex (and boring) parts using a strongly-typed interface. We use the builder pattern wherever possibile to move the checks at compile time.
