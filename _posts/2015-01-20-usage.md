# Usage

Usage is very simple with Cargo, just put this line in your `Cargo.toml` and you are ready to go:

```rust
azure_sdk_for_rust = "{{ site.version }}"
```

You can optionally build against the GitHub repo. While I strive to keep `master` working, there are no guarantees that the library compiles (let alone work as expected). I will try to publish frequent updates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/azure_sdk_for_rust) so `master` should be used only if you want to contribute to this library.


You will find lots of examples in the [examples](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust/tree/master/examples) folder. If you find that something is missing/obscure please open an issue and I will happily expand the example section.
